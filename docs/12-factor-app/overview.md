Overview of Twelve-Factor App principles.

# Twelve-Factor App Principles

The [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) methodology provides guidelines for building scalable, maintainable web applications. This project adheres to these principles to ensure robustness and portability.

## Principles
1. **Codebase**: One codebase, multiple deploys.
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
3. **Config**: Store configuration in the environment.
4. **Backing Services**: Treat backing services as attached resources.
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Strictly separate build and run stages.
6. **Processes**: Execute the app as stateless processes.
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding.
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model.
9. **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown.
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development and production similar.
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams.
12. **Admin Processes**: Run admin tasks as one-off processes.

Each principle is detailed in the following sections.
